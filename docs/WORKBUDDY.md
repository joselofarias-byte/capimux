# WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy International

9router-go supports two deliberately separate CodeBuddy/WorkBuddy paths:

- `codebuddy-intl`: direct international chat endpoint authenticated with a personal API key.
- `workbuddy-session`: local execution through the official CodeBuddy CLI using an already authenticated browser-login session. This path is useful when an account can use CodeBuddy but cannot create an API key, including the Free account used for validation on 2026-09-10.

Do not merge the credential semantics of these two providers. An API key is an ordinary API credential; a saved CLI login is a product/account session and receives more conservative routing treatment.

## API-key route (`codebuddy-intl`)

For accounts that can create a personal API key, use:

https://www.codebuddy.ai/profile/keys

The official CLI also accepts `CODEBUDDY_API_KEY`. Do not commit a key, paste it into issue/PR text, or store it in shell history.

The direct upstream chat provider is:

- provider: `codebuddy-intl`
- endpoint: `https://www.codebuddy.ai/v2/chat/completions`
- stream transport: required by CodeBuddy; 9router aggregates it automatically for non-stream clients
- auth: Bearer plus `X-API-Key` compatibility header
- aliases: `workbuddy`, `wb`, `cbai`

Because personal API-key authentication is an officially documented path for individual developers, Fabric classifies `codebuddy-intl` as a normal low-risk API-key route. Normal quota and health controls still apply.

### API-key Termux bootstrap

From a checkout of this repository:

```bash
bash scripts/workbuddy-termux-bootstrap.sh
```

The script installs missing dependencies, installs the official CodeBuddy CLI, opens the API-key page, imports the credential through 9router, runs a low-cost probe, reports usage telemetry, and writes a credential-free snapshot to `~/.config/9router-go/workbuddy-last-probe.json`.

The default local router URL is `http://127.0.0.1:20128`.

#### Authentication

Importing a provider credential is an admin action, so the bootstrap imports with the **local admin token** (`x-9r-cli-token`). A client API key is not enough.

- **Import.** `POST /api/oauth/codebuddy-intl/import` carries `x-9r-cli-token`. The script derives that token from the router's data dir and never prints, logs or passes it on the command line. It writes the token to a temporary `0600` header file, which is deleted on exit.
  - The token is `sha256(machine-id + "9r-cli-auth" + auth/cli-secret)`, first 16 hex characters. Both files live in `DATA_DIR`.
  - The script looks in `NINEROUTER_DATA_DIR`, then `DATA_DIR`, then the default `~/.9router`. If 9router-go runs with another data dir, export it before running the script.
  - If either file is readable by group or others, the script refuses to continue and asks you to `chmod 600` them.
  - If the files do not exist yet, the script makes one harmless request so the router creates them.
- **Probe.** `POST /chat/completions` still uses a normal client API key, from `NINEROUTER_API_KEY` or the legacy file `~/.config/9router-go/admin-token` (despite its name, that file holds a client API key). The key is optional when the router does not require one.

Run the script as the same Termux user, on the same device as 9router-go, so it can read the data dir. Nothing else needs to change on an existing install.

#### Client API keys and credentials

With login enforced, a request authenticated only by a client API key follows the admin-only setting `allowClientCredentialImport`:

- not set, or `false`: no credential import or creation with a client API key (HTTP 403);
- `true`: client keys may add new credentials through the append-only imports and `POST /api/connections`, without `baseUrl`/endpoint/proxy fields. The new connection always goes to the end of the rotation.

A client API key can never overwrite an existing credential, change priorities or the rotation order, delete connections, or create, edit or delete provider nodes, whatever the value. It also cannot rename, enable or disable a connection, assign it a model, change any other connection field, run a connection test (the test writes the result back), consume Codex reset credits, switch the Freebuff seat, or create, edit, delete or test proxy pools: all of these need the admin session or the local admin token. A client API key only *uses* the connections. The bootstrap is not affected: it imports with the local admin token and only probes `/chat/completions` with the client key.

#### Reverting

- To let client API keys import again (for example an older copy of this script that sends `Authorization: Bearer`), an admin sets `allowClientCredentialImport` to `true`. Do this from the dashboard with an admin session, or with the local admin token: `PATCH /api/settings` with `{"allowClientCredentialImport": true}`. Remove the setting, or set it to `false`, to close imports again.
- To go back to the previous behaviour entirely, run a build from before PR #158.

## Free/session route (`workbuddy-session`)

The Free validation account could not create an API key: the CodeBuddy profile UI marked API Keys as a Pro-only feature. The same account could, however, log in through the official CodeBuddy CLI using `International Site` and use its Free/bonus credits. The CLI persists that authenticated session under its own account state, and 9router can invoke it without extracting or copying the credential.

Install and log in once:

```bash
pkg install -y nodejs
npm install -g @tencent-ai/codebuddy-code
codebuddy
```

Choose `International Site` when prompted, finish the browser login, and then exit the interactive CLI. No CodeBuddy token is entered into 9router.

Use the session-backed provider explicitly:

```text
workbuddy-session/gpt-5.6-luna
```

Equivalent provider aliases are `wbs`, `wbf`, and `workbuddy-free`, for example:

```text
wbs/gpt-5.6-luna
```

The existing `workbuddy` and `wb` aliases intentionally remain mapped to `codebuddy-intl` for backwards compatibility with API-key users.

### Session execution policy

The session executor is intentionally conservative:

- it shells out with `exec.CommandContext`; no user-controlled shell command is constructed;
- requests are serialized one at a time to avoid hammering a quota-limited personal session;
- a quota/rate-limit result pauses further CLI invocations for one minute in the current router process; requests during that pause receive a safe 429 so configured fallback routes can continue;
- Auto Memory and CodeBuddy background tasks are disabled for each routed request;
- each invocation uses one turn and disables session persistence;
- the working directory defaults to the user's home directory and can be overridden with `WORKBUDDY_SESSION_CWD`;
- the CLI executable can be overridden with `WORKBUDDY_CODEBUDDY_PATH`;
- no `-y` / permission-bypass flag is used;
- tools, tool-call history, and image input are rejected for now rather than silently degraded;
- streaming clients are supported with a buffered single-result SSE response. The underlying CodeBuddy invocation is currently one-shot headless rather than token-by-token streaming.

Fabric classifies this route as a medium-risk product surface with conservative probe policy. It remains usable as a fallback but should lose ties against equivalent ordinary API-key/no-auth providers.

## Credit telemetry

CodeBuddy current clients expose actual credit consumption inside assistant event telemetry as `providerData.rawUsage.credit`. The API-key CodeBuddy SSE path preserves the upstream `usage` object. The session executor parses the official CLI JSON event stream and returns an OpenAI-compatible `usage.credit` field alongside token/cache counts.

Do not estimate credits from visible user tokens alone. CodeBuddy injects substantial internal context and may charge according to model/session behavior that is not represented by the small user prompt.

### Observed Free-session baseline

On 2026-09-10, GPT-5.6 Luna was validated twice on the same Free account:

| Mode | Credit | Prompt tokens | Cache write | Output |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Default headless | 0.50 | 19,885 | 19,882 | 8 |
| Lean headless | 0.35 | 13,930 | 13,927 | 8 |

The lean invocation reduced both reported credit consumption and injected prompt/cache volume by about 30%. These are observations, not guaranteed pricing. Real tasks can consume more.

The lean settings validated on Termux are equivalent to:

```bash
CODEBUDDY_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1 \
CODEBUDDY_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1 \
CODEBUDDY_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=1 \
codebuddy \
  -p \
  --model gpt-5.6-luna \
  --max-turns 1 \
  --no-session-persistence \
  --system-prompt 'You are a general-purpose assistant. Answer the user directly. Do not use tools.' \
  --output-format json \
  'Respond exactly: WB_OK'
```

The `workbuddy-session` executor applies those settings automatically.

## Official CLI and local service

The upstream CLI requires Node.js 18+ and can be installed with:

```bash
npm install -g @tencent-ai/codebuddy-code
```

CodeBuddy also exposes a beta local HTTP service:

```bash
codebuddy --serve --port 8080
```

Keep its default authentication enabled. The session adapter does not depend on that server; it invokes the official headless CLI on demand so there is no permanent extra daemon.

## Model availability

Do not hard-code the WorkBuddy web selector as a permanent catalog. Model availability and account entitlements can change. Treat a model as usable only after the current account exposes it and a probe succeeds.

On 2026-09-10 the validated account exposed GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna, GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4, GPT-5.3-Codex, Gemini-3.5-Flash, GLM-5.3, GLM-5.2, Kimi-K3, Kimi-K2.6, and MiniMax-M3 in the CLI selector. GPT-6 Astra was not exposed by that account at that time. This is an observed snapshot, not a provider guarantee.
