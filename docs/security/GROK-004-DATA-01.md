# GROK-004 / DATA-01 — Privacy safeguards (draft)

Status: **review-only**. No deployment or migration has been run.

## Scope

* GET `/api/usage/request-details` is now mounted only inside `RequireAdminAuth()`; an ordinary active inference API key no longer grants access. Valid admin cookie or local CLI token is required, **including when `requireLogin=false`**.
* Diagnostic prompt and response *content* is **not persisted by default**. Metrics used for cost/tokens continue to be computed.
* `CAPIMUX_CAPTURE_REQUEST_CONTENT=true` explicitly re-enables the legacy detailed capture. Use only with informed consent. Current capture is bounded but is **not a guaranteed secrets redactor**; avoid enabling it for shared/multi-tenant workloads.
* `CAPIMUX_REQUEST_DETAILS_RETENTION_DAYS`: 1–365, default 7. Missing, malformed or out-of-range values fall back to 7 days.
* Expired `requestDetails` are pruned after roughly every 128 inserts (including first insert), and when viewing details at most once every 10 minutes. Reads always filter by the retention cutoff, so expired rows are never shown even when the read skips the purge. A failed cleanup is logged and never reported as a failed insert.
* With content capture off, a failed request keeps only the HTTP status and the upstream `error.type` / `error.code`, and only when they are short identifiers (`[A-Za-z0-9_.:-]{1,64}`). The message is stored as `request failed`.
* `DELETE /api/usage/request-details` (admin only) purges all diagnostic records. It requires `X-Capimux-Confirm: purge-request-details`; aggregate usage metrics are retained. No automatic purge is triggered by opening this PR.

## Important limitations

* **Existing history remains until pruning or an explicit purge.** The default content-capture change is not retroactive.
* SQLite `DELETE` is a *logical removal*, not secure wiping. WAL, old snapshots, filesystem copies, and backup media may still contain data; follow a separate retention/compaction and recovery policy.
* Admin cookies and CLI tokens still reveal permitted diagnostic content; protect them like administrative secrets.
* Endpoint protection only covers `requestDetails`. Additional API-key/dashboard routes still need separate privacy review.
* Runtime Go tests and GitHub CI must pass before this can merge. This PR must remain draft until validated.

## Validation checklist

- [ ] `go test ./internal/handlers ./internal/handlers/chat ./internal/db`
- [ ] `go test -race ./internal/handlers ./internal/handlers/chat ./internal/db`
- [ ] Confirm active inference key gets 401 on GET and DELETE.
- [ ] Confirm authenticated admin session gets 200 on GET.
- [ ] Confirm DELETE without confirmation header gets 428 and with header succeeds.
- [ ] Confirm default diagnostic records contain no prompt/response canaries.
- [ ] Confirm retention purges rows older than configured cutoff.
- [ ] Verify frontend details UI behavior and Android/Termux packaging.
